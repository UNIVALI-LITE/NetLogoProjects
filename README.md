# NetLogo - Bifocal Modeling - Univali + Stanford

Bifocal Modeling is a new framework to inquiry-driven science learning. It challenges students to experience a scientific phenomenon through two lenses in parallel â€“ a real experiment and a model. In these activities, students explore a scientific phenomenon such as heat diffusion, properties of gases, or wave propagation by designing an experiment and a model and connecting them in real time.
